# Change record

## 2026-09-05 · Sol completion

### Completed

- Finished the bounded readability pass across the shared reader, dashboard,
  profile, consensus report, solver, MTL guide, and Jekyll source without changing
  domain data, puzzle rules, telemetry authority, or chart geometry.
- Made shared print rules authoritative over later consumer selectors and added a
  solver-specific legacy dark-mode print reset. Dark pages now print black on
  white with theme controls hidden.
- Added full accessible names and titles for compact Japanese Sums and A38
  candidate marks while preserving their fixed board geometry.
- Repaired the U-Bahn worker's hidden Cancel control, added a source regression
  check, rebuilt the standalone file, and cancelled a running 16×16 search in the
  browser.
- Corrected Albatross's narrow reader-control grid after candidate-theme testing
  demonstrated document-wide overflow. Updated Black Sheep Town's shared-reader
  regression expectations for the released typography and wrapping behavior.
- Completed rendered checks at 390px/1440px, light/dark, coarse pointer, doubled
  text, keyboard focus, print, offline solver operation, dashboard state fixtures,
  data explorer interactions, and external v2 consumers.
- Built the private Jekyll source with its own bundle. Confirmed it has Pages
  disabled; the public root is `JWKNT/JWKNT.github.io` with the `jehlp.net` CNAME.
- Installed all six maintained skills into local Codex discovery through the
  idempotent symlink installer.

See `VALIDATION.md` for observed evidence and `REPOSITORIES.md` for the verified
Pages mapping.

### Implemented

- Shared v2: body/interface/metadata/control tokens, larger regular labels and
  navigation, visible scrollbars, coarse-pointer sizing, focus for named scroll
  regions, skip-link positioning, reduced toggle motion, and explicit print ink.
- Theme controller: same-origin cross-tab synchronization; clearing a preference
  resumes system mode; migration tolerates read-only storage; late-parsed browser
  chrome metadata is synchronized at setup. Legacy keys and both events remain.
- MTL guide: 16px reading, readable labels and contents, code-button clearance,
  an in-flow mobile contents disclosure, and active-section accessibility metadata.
  Regenerated the 14 document pages from `build.js`.
- Main Jekyll site: repaired `--bg-color` from undefined `--canvas` to `--paper`;
  retained 16px mobile reading and allowed navigation to wrap.
- Profile / consensus report / NGU dashboard: targeted regular-control, navigation,
  connection-state, and headline label improvements. Dataset and app logic retained.
  The consensus dialog now has its visible title as its accessible name.
- Solver: skip link, named puzzle navigation, clearer secondary controls, visible
  mobile tab scrolling; embedded theme masks/favicon and rebuilt standalone HTML.
- Added six Codex skills, installation helper, inventory, design decisions,
  regression guidance, and the Sol handoff. No framework or data dependency added.

### Deliberately remaining

This is a prepared implementation and handoff, not a claim that every site is
finished. Browser screenshots, keyboard traversal, mobile reflow, 200% text zoom,
print preview, deployed routing, and the Jekyll build require local follow-through.
Small chart/candidate labels and `v2/reader.css` remain a measured follow-up.
The bot and puzzle research harness are inventoried and unchanged.

See `VALIDATION.md` for observed checks and `SOL-HANDOFF.md` for the ordered work.
